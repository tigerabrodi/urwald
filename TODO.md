# Urwald - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for Urwald, a lightweight, zero-dependency UI library focused on type safety and modern browser features.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality âœ…

- [x] Set up project structure with tsup and vitest
- [x] Implement element creator (el)
- [x] Implement reactive state management
- [x] Implement basic router

## Phase 2: Reliability & Documentation

- [x] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all public APIs
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and linting
- [x] Add bundle size monitoring to CI

## Phase 3: Real-world Usability

- [ ] Support nested state objects with deep reactivity
- [ ] Implement utility functions for common patterns
- [ ] Add event delegation for better performance
- [ ] Enhance router with query parameter support
- [ ] Add basic form handling utilities
- [ ] Create animation utilities using the View Transitions API
- [ ] Implement an `effect()` function for handling side effects in response to state changes
- [ ] Implement a Vite plugin for enhanced development experience

## Phase 4: Data & Backend Integration

- [ ] Implement data fetching utilities (inspired by TanStack Query)
- [ ] Add state persistence options (localStorage, sessionStorage)
- [ ] Create backend communication patterns with fetch wrappers
- [ ] Add utilities for form validation and submission
- [ ] Implement simple caching mechanisms

## Phase 5: Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement DOM diffing for efficient updates
- [ ] Add batched rendering for multiple state changes
- [ ] Optimize memory usage with pooling for frequent operations
- [ ] Add tree-shaking optimization
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for routes
- [ ] Add virtual lists for handling large datasets

## Phase 6: Developer Experience

- [ ] Add development mode with helpful warnings
- [ ] Implement debugging tools for state visualization
- [ ] Create performance monitoring utilities
- [ ] Add browser DevTools extension
- [ ] Provide component composition patterns and guidelines

## Phase 7: Advanced Features

- [ ] Add middleware system for router
- [ ] Implement component lifecycle hooks
- [ ] Enhance animation utilities with advanced transitions and effects
- [ ] Add more sophisticated state management for complex applications
- [ ] Create utilities for WebSocket integration

## Phase 8: Ecosystem Development

- [ ] Create component library (UI kit)
- [ ] Add theming support
- [ ] Add server-side rendering support
- [ ] Create adapters for popular backend frameworks
- [ ] Develop full-stack example applications

## Phase 9: Enterprise Features

- [ ] Add accessibility testing utilities
- [ ] Implement internationalization support
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Create performance monitoring tools
- [ ] Add security hardening features (XSS protection, etc)
